You need to create several pages and paste the relevant shortcodes so your customer can submit their support requests.

If you have found a bug or have a recommendation submit a ticket https://github.com/orbisius/orbisius-support-tickets/issues or open a pull request https://github.com/orbisius/orbisius-support-tickets/pulls
